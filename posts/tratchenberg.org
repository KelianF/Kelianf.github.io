* Trachtenberg Method or how to overcomplicate multiplications

The Trachtenberg system is a method for rapid mental calculation developped by Jakow Trachtenberg.

Here below we represent the algos for multiplication going from 5 to 12.

Multiplication by 5

#+begin_src python
for MultiplyBy5(xyz):
    xyz = str(xyz)
    res = ""
    if xyz[-1]%2:
        res+="0"
    else:
        res+="5"
