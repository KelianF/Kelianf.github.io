So, what is a simulation? It is the process of representing a system by a model and then executing this model to generate raw data. The model is a conceptual representation of the system, an approximation. The raw data is also referred to as simulation data. 
</p>

<p>
A simulation process can be divided in 6 steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The problem description. When starting, a question should be gven to then find an answer.</li>
<li>System description. It could be for example the different states and agents (to use a RL language)</li>
<li>Model construction. This is an iterative process, in which the goal is to formulate a formal description of the system.</li>
<li>Computer Program. Code it up.</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis. Select relevant metrics and monitor them; for example Sharpe, VaR and Calmar Ratio in Finance.</li>
<li>Performance Summary. Last part, the answer to the question with given confidence interval and conclusion as well as possible recommendations.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89f0464">
<p>
A conceptual model is a representation of a system using specialized concepts and terms (e.g. a mathematical model for of a system is constructed using specialized concepts such as constants, variables, functions…). 
</p>

<p>
A conceptual model can be constructed using five elements: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Entity, it represent the object in the system that must be explicitely captured in the model in order to be able to describe the overall operation of the system.</li>
<li>Attributes, related to the entity (e.g. arrival time, weight, ..)</li>
<li>State Variable, The state of the system under study is represented by a set of state variables, which each track a property of a static entity over time.</li>
<li>Event, It represents the occurence of something interesting inside the system. It is a stimulus that cause the system to change its state.</li>
<li>Activities, are the action performed by the system for a finite duration of time.</li>

<h3 id="orgd34018c">Simulation Probabilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd34018c">
<p>
A probability is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. It is assigned to each possible outcome in the sample space of a random experiement. Probabilities must be assigned to outcomes in such a way that they add up to one. Then the probability of an event is is simply the sum of the proobabilities of the individual outcomes making up the event.
</p>

<p>
The Axioms of Probability:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>∃ outcome w<sub>i</sub> ∈ Ω, P(w<sub>i</sub>) ∈ [0, 1],</li>
<li>∀ Outcomes w<sub>i</sub> ∈ Ω, ∑<sub>i</sub> P(w<sub>i</sub>) = 1,</li>
<li>For each event E<sub>j</sub> ⊂ Ω, P(E<sub>j</sub>)=∑<sub>i</sub> P(w<sub>i</sub>), where w<sub>i</sub> ∈ E<sub>j</sub>,</li>
<li>∀ Possible disjoint events E<sub>j</sub> ⊂ Ω:</li>
</ol>
<p>
$P({∪<sub>j</sub> E<sub>j</sub>}) = ∑<sub>j</sub> P(E<sub>j</sub>) $
</p>


<p>
The Law of Large number 
</p>

<p>
Let x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, …, x<sub>n</sub> be a set of sample (realization/outcomes of a random experiement), then with probability 1:

<p>
&lt;center&gt;\(lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}\)&lt;/center&gt;

<h3 id="org57e4195">Simulating Random Variables and Stochastic Processes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org57e4195">
<p>
A dynamic system can be viewed as either a sequence of random variables or a stochastic process.
In the former, the system evolves in discrete steps and its state changes at discrete instants of time.
In the latter, however, the system evolves continuously over time and the times at which events occur cannot be predicted.
Random variables are mathematical abstractions which are defined on the sample space of a random experiement. In other term, a random variable is a function which associate a probability whith each possible outcome of a random experiement.
</p>



<p>
Probability Mass functions refers to the probability function for a discrete random variable. 
The PMF is defined as follow:
p<sub>X</sub>(x) = P[X=x]I
t follows the two following properties:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>p<sub>X</sub>(x) ≥ 0, and</li>
<li>∑<sub>x</sub> p<sub>X</sub>(x) = 1</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cumulative Distribution Function of a dicrete random variable X, denoted F<sub>X</sub>(x), is defined as follow:
F<sub>X</sub>(x)=P(X ≤ x)
     =∑<sub>(i≤ x)</sub>P<sub>x</sub>(i)
</p>

<p>
Basically, the CDF gives the probability that the value of the random variable X is less than or equal to x. Thus, it is a monotonically non-decreasing function of X.
</p>


<p>
Probability Density Function is the equivalent of PMF but for continous function. The PDF is a non-negative, continous function denoted by f<sub>X</sub>(x).
Here is the relationship between PDF and CDF:
$ f<sub>X</sub>(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F<sub>X</sub>(x) $
$ F<sub>X</sub>(x) = ∫<sub>-∞</sub>^∞ f<sub>X</sub>(x)dx

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org11bab2b">
<p>
A random variable cannot be used to describe the behaviour of a dynamic system since it does not involve time. Enter the world of stochastic processes. At every instant in time, the state of the process is random. Since time is fixed, we can thinkk of the state of the process as a random variable at that specific instant.
</p>

<p>
Ergodic system: IF a dynamic system is run for a long perios of time, then each possible system state would be visited. Then, the mean over the state space (i.e. ensemble mean) can be approximated by the mean of a sample path through the state space (i.e. temporal space). Such dynamic systems are referred to as ergodic system, wherein the temporal mean converges to the ensemble mean.

<a id="org72211d9"></a>Discrete-time Markov Chains<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org72211d9">
<p>
A discrete-time Markov chain stays in any state for an amount of time which is geometrically distributed. A Markov Chain is said to be fully characterized if its probability transition matrix is known. 
An entry P<sub>ij</sub> in this matrix represents the probability that the process will make a transition from state i to state j, where i is the present state and j is the next state. 
Consider a Discrete-Time MArkov Chain with two states: Good (G) and Bad (B). Let the transition Matrix of this DMTC be the following:
</p>

<p>
P(i, j) = \bordermatrix{ &amp; G &amp; B \cr
G &amp; .5 &amp; .5 \cr
B &amp; .7 &amp; .3 \qquad
</p>

<p>
Noticing that every row and colun is labeled. This matrixx is an example of the classical Gilbert-Elliot two-state wireless channel model.
</p>

<p>
Given that the present state is X<sub>n</sub> = G, the next state X<sub>(n+1)</sub> has the following PMF:
P(X<sub>(n+1)</sub> = G  X<sub>n</sub> = G) = .5; P(X<sub>(n+1)</sub>=B | X<sub>n</sub> = G) = .5
and assuming that X<sub>n</sub> = B then the next state X<sub>(n+1)</sub> has the following PMF:
P(X<sub>(n+1)</sub> = G | X<sub>n</sub> = B) = .7; P(X<sub>(n+1)</sub> = B | X<sub>n</sub> = G) = .3
</p>

<p>
Since we know the PMF for the next state given any present state, we can now simulate the DTMC.

<a id="org21264c8"></a>Continuous-time Markov Chain<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org21264c8">
<p>
When a continuous-time Markov chain enters a state, it remains in the state for an amount of time exponentially distributed.
</p>




<p>
A Poisson process is an example of a Continous-Time Markov Chain. The time between two consecutive events is called the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT). The random variable IAT has an exponential distribution. Only one kind of event triggers a transition inside a Poisson process, this event is the arrival event. 
</p>

<p>
The Poisson Process is a special case of another type of random processes called Birth-Date Processes. In a BD Process, two events occur: Birth and Death. The Poisson process is a pure Birth process, since the Birth (i.e. arrival) event occurs only. The state of a BD process changes at random points of time. The state variable is incremented by only one when a birth event occurs. it is decremented by one, on the other hand, when a Death occurs. The time until the next birth is exponenetially distributed with rate λ. Similarly, the time until the next death is exponentially distributed with a rate μ.

<h4 id="orgdc52beb">Simulation Model</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdc52beb">
<p>
A single server queuing system is composed of four components: Source, Buffer, Server and Sink.
The Source generates packets which go into a FIFO buffer, the server fethes the packets from the buffer and then deliers them to the sink after they are processed.
Since the individual inter-arrival times and service times are unpredictable, they shoul be modelled as random variables. Thus we need to specify the probability distribution of these random variables. The choice of a specific probability distribution has to be supported by an evidence that it is appropriate. The exponential probability distribution is a reasonable model of the inter-arrival and service time.
</p>

<p>
What cause Delay?
→ When multiple packets contend for one server, some packets will be queued and system performance suffers. If the service time is always less than or equal to the inter-arrival time, no packet is queued. In reality, however, the service time and inter-arrival times are not constant. Also, packets may require different service times. This variability in service times and inter arrival times causes the delay through the single-server queueing system.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org65d66b2">
<p>
Throughput, it measures how many packets the system can process in one time unitl. It is defined as the ratio of the number of departure divided by the total simulation time. Mathematically, this law can be written as follow:
$ τ = \frac{D}{T} $
</p>

<p>
Utization, ro server utilization, is the proportion of simulation time during which the server is busy. It is the product of its throughput and the average service time per customer. This can be mathematically be expressed as follows:
U = τ . T<sub>s</sub>
Where T<sub>s</sub> is the average service time per customer and it is defined as follows:
$ T<sub>s</sub> = \frac{B}{D} $
</p>

<p>
Where B is the total server busy time which can be computed as follows:
B = ∑<sub>(i=1)</sub><sup>D</sup> T<sub>i</sub>
Where T<sub>i</sub> is the service time for customer i.
</p>

<p>
Response Time, it is the total time a customer spends in the system. This includes waiting time and service time. it is defined as:
$ W = \frac{\sum_(i=1)^D W_i}{D} $
As a consequence the average number of packets in the system can be computed as follows:
L = τ . W
</p>

<p>
Little's Laws
L = λ . W
This law asserts that the time average number of packets in the system is the product of the arrival rate and the response time. This law is due to Little Who proved it in 1961. With λ is a parameter of the arrival Poisson process.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org632694e">
<p>
George Box: "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
</p>

<p>
Event graphs are a formal modeling tool which can be used for building discrete-event simulation models. It shows the scheduling relationships between events which occur inside the sytem. An event graph is constructed using vertices and directed edges with attributes and conditions. 
</p>

<p>
Translating event graphs into code is the main part of this category. The propozed high-level concepts will help in mechanizing the translation process and enhancing the maintainability of the resulting code.
These high level processes are the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Event type</li>
<li>Event generator</li>
<li>Event handler</li>
<li>Initial event</li>
<li>Simulation loop</li>
</ol>
<p>
An event type is the base concept and it includes two subconcepts: event generator and event handler. The event generator is an abstraction of a block of code which returns a realization of an event type.
On the other hand an event handler is an abstraction of a block of codewhich updates the state of the simulation model in response to an event. Two tasks are performed inside the handler: 1. Updating state variables and 2. Scheduling next events. After an event is fully executed, coontrol is returned to the main simulation loop.

<p>
This simulation approach is also reffered to as discrete-time simulation. The reason for this name is because the simulation evolves in discrete steps, slots, of size Δ.t.
</p>

<p>
The single-server queueing system can be modeled in two ways: discrete-time and continuous-time. In discrrete-time queues, time evolves in discrete steps of the same size. On the other hand, in continous time queues, events can occur at any point on the time line.
Continous time uses Poisson Distribution for Arrival and Departure Processes and  Exponential for Inter-Arrival and service times; whilst Discrete-time uses Bernoulli for Arrival and Derparture and Geometric for Inter-arrival and Service Times.

<h4 id="orgc4effdc">Event-Driven Simulation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc4effdc">
<p>
This approach to simulation is also called discrete-event suimulation. In this type of simulation, time evolves in discrete steps of random sizes. Hence, events happen at random point on the time line. Also, the time between two consecutive events is random.
An event driven simulation program consists of two components: simulator and model. Events are generated by the model, they are applied back to the model by the simulator. The simulator is responsible for maintaining the temporal order of events using the event list. It is also responsible for keeping the current simulated time up to date. 
The simulator contains a Random Number Generator, which generate random numbers which are then used to drive the Random Variate Generator. 
It follows:
Seed → Random Number Generator → Random Variate Generator → Random Event Generator → Event
</p>

<p>
A Flowchart of the event-driven simulation can be separated in 4 components:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Initialization:</li>
<li>Simulation Parameters</li>
<li>State Variables</li>
<li>Output variable- Event list</li>
<li>clock = 0</li>

<li>Simulation loop</li>
<li>EV = EventList.nextEvent()</li>
<li>clock = ev.Time</li>
<li>ev.EventHandler( clock )</li>

<li>Event Handler for event type 1:</li>
<li>Update state and output variables</li>
<li>Generate and schedule new events</li>

<li>Output:</li>
<li>Compute performance estimates using output variables</li>
</ol>
<p>
Several programming issues arise when writing event-driven simulation programs. Below are 3 of the most critical:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Event Collision: An event is represented by a tuple inside each event generator. When inserted into the event list, the field in the tuple is used as a key for sorting the event. When two events have the same key, an event collision is said to have happened.</li>
<li>Identifiers for Packets: When recording data in output variables, the order of packets must be maintained. That is, the i<sup>th</sup> entry in any output variable must correspond to the i<sup>th</sup> simulated packet. If this order is not maintained, the final statistical results will be wrong.</li>
<li>Stopping condition for the simulated loop: There are several options to terminate a simulation loop. 1. Event List becomes empty, 2. Number of simulated packet reaches a preset value, and 3. Maximum allowed simulation time is reached.</li>

The MC Method can be used to estimate the value of a pareter or constant. For example it can be used to estimate the value of π, which is the ratio of the cirumference of a circle to its diameter; π is approximately equal to 3.14159.
Consider a full circle with radius r and a centered at the origin. This circle is also enclosed inside a square with an edge length of 2r. A point (x, y) falls inside the circle if the following inequality is satisfied:
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> ≤ r<sup>2</sup>
Both x and y takes values from the interval [-1, 1]. r has fixed value of 1.
Having a Circle (C) in a Square (S), the probability that a point (x, y) lies inside C is given by:
$ P[(x, y) ∈ C] = \frac{measure of C}{measure of S} $
$ = \frac{area of C}{area of S} $
$ = \frac{\pi.r^2}{4r^2} $
$ =\frac{\pi}{4} $
</p>

<p>
Hence the following equation for π can be deduced:
π = 4.P
Now we have the expression for π but need to find P, the probability of having a point inside C vs S.

$ A<sub>I</sub> = ∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f(x)dx $
The probability that a randomly generated point falls inside region I can be computed as follows:
$ P = \frac{A_I}{A_J} $
where the area of region J is equal to A<sub>J</sub> = c . (b - a).

$ E[X] = \frac{1}{n}∑<sup>n</sup> X<sub>i</sub>-c(\frac{1}{n}∑<sup>n</sup> Y<sub>i</sub>-E[Y]) $

<p>
It has to be noted that n → ∞ ; \(\frac{1}{n}\sum^n Y_i\) → E[Y]
Hence, the second term evaluates to zero. However since the number of samples is finite, the samples of Y are going to reduce the variance in the estimator of E[X]. The result is an estimator that is better than using only Monte Carlo.

in Importance sampling, samples are generated using a new probability distribution q that is more appropriate than the original probability distribution p.
However, since the new probability distribution q is different from the correct distribution p, a correction step is necessary.
Imagine a distribution in which region 2  will be generated more frequently because of the large porbabilities over this region. However, the values of the function in region 1 are more important. How is it possible to sample more from that regions? Thi is the reason this method is reffered to as importance sampling. Since Values sampled from region 1 have more impact, they should be sampled more frequently. So the correction step is very simple, every sample generated using q(x) is multiplied by a weight w(x)= p(x)/q(x) to account for the importance weight.

Rembembering that a randon variable is a function that takes as an input a numerical value and returns a probability. If this function is inverset, we get a function that takes a probability and returns a numerical value. 
For this to work, invertinga CDF of an exponentional random variable for example, hs to give exactly only one number on the x-axis. On the other hand, the inversion method works differently on discrete random variables. In that case the relationship is many-to-one, that is multiple random numbers can be mapped onto one random variate.
Finally it should be emphasized that only CDFs of continous random variables and PMF of discrete random variables can be inversed. This is because these two functions are actual probability functions. The PDF of a continous random variable is a not a probability function since it can take values greater than one.

An interesting fact is that the linear combination of CDFs, PDFs, or PMFs is also a CFD, PDF or PMF, repsectively.

Hence, a probability distribution can be represented as a mixture of simpler probability distribution functions.
The Composition Method works as follows. First, the probability function is decomposed into a weighted sum of K simpler probability functions.
Secondly, one of the probability distribution that appear in the composition is randomly selected. f<sub>i</sub> is selected with probability p<sub>i</sub>. Finally, a sample is generated using the selected probability distribution function by using either the inversion or rejection method.

The second test which is referred to as the poker test ensures that there is no correlation between the successive random numbers. This way the numbers are independent from each other. A RNG is accepted if it passes these two tests.

<p>
This test is mainly used for determining how well the observed data fit the theorethically expected data. The test performed as follows:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Divide the interval [0, 1[ into K non-overlapping subintervals of equal length.</li>
<li>Determine O<sub>i</sub> for each subinterval i, where o<sub>i</sub> is the number of random numbers that fall in subinterval i and 1 ≤ i ≤ K</li>
<li>Determine E<sub>i</sub> for each subinterval i, where E<sub>i</sub> is the expected number of random numbers that should fall in subinterval i</li>
<li>Compute the Chi-Squared statistic χ<sup>2</sup> given by the equation</li>
</ol>
<p>
$ χ<sup>2</sup> = ∑<sup>K</sup><sub>i=1</sub> \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} $
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For a level of significance α, if χ<sup>2</sup> ≤ χ<sup>2</sup><sub>K-1,1-α</sub> then it is concluded that the random numbers in the given sequence are uniformaly distributed with ((1-α) x 100)% level of confidence.</li>

<p>
A sequence of random numbers might be uniformly distributed and yet not random. This because because the random numbers may be related. The poker test is used to detect any such relationship. However, before applying the poker test, the sequence of random numbers must be pre-processed using the following two steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Remove the decimal pojnt in every rando number</li>
<li>Choose the first five digits in every random number. You may need to round the numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Following the above procedure, we will end up with a sequence of five digit numbers.

<a id="org7cda982"></a>The Spectral Test<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7cda982">
<p>
The test is used for detecting correlations among random numbers. Basically, the random numbers are grouped into triplets. These triplets are plotted in 3D space.
Planes will emerge if the random numbers are correlted.
