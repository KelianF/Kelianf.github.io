Some programs cannot be run with more than x number of core, for power reasons or because of a specific license. This is the case of Q/KdB which has, with the free individual version, a maximum of 16 possible cores.

In windows, the solution for this is the following command line:
#+begin_src bash
start /affinity 1 q.exe
#+end_src

This will start q with only one core. The number of core is defined in hex number.
so, if we want 4 cores we have to select 'F', if we want 8 'FF' and finally 16 would be 'FFFF'.
